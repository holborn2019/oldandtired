stygmorgan <C> 2006 by Josep Andreu

I'm sorry for the english :-)


Introduction
============

stygmorgan is an emulator of which nowadays the manufacturers of musical
keyboards denominate like Interactive Workstation, that is to say, an organ with
automatic accompaniment and capable to create more or less complex musical
sequences.

stygmorgan means a step ahead on the old project "gmorgan" because it uses real
time patterns, the source code of the program has been rewritten practically
completely. 

stygmorgan is the union of "style" "GM" and "organ",

style: By the fact of being able to read .STY files (Files of musical styles) 
"GM" the General Midi standard, because by default it comes to be used with an
external sound source General Midi capable, a basic configuration of sounds to
cause that most of keyboards, synthesizers ...could be compatible.
"organ" to clarify the clothes? because with so many abbreviations he is
preferable to call the things by its name.

Two differentiated parts co-exist in stygmorgan:

The organ, that is the part of the program that allows to turn a MIDI keyboard
to an organ with automatic accompaniment.

The sequencer, that allows to create and export as Midi File musical sequences. 

The main new features with respect to gmorgan are:

- Patterns in real time.
- Read files of styles in sty, prs, mid formats.
- Chord Recognition. (Fingered Bass)
- Recognized Chords multiplied by ten. 
- New techniques of harmonization, the possibilities increase proportion to the
  chords.
- Sensible graphical improvements.
- New ALSA sequencer auto connection .
- Load soundfonts at the startup.
- The number of simultaneous sounds for the right part of the keyboard ups to
  three.
- Recordings.
- Edition functions for the new format of style/pattern.

The main newness with respect to gmorgan is the capacity to read and to
reproduce files .STY, the old gmorgan use styles created in the own program,
like a tracker, it was, an arduous single task within reach of people with ample
musical knowledge, in addition it was limited seven tracks by pattern, that is
to say, to almost create a style with his corresponding patterns was a
impossible mission.

Files .STY provide styles up to 22 patterns, each one up to 16 real time tracks
, and although simultaneously single they reproduce 8, is able to reproduce one
or other tracks depending on the specified chord. That is to say, a pattern can
completely be different depending the chord is major, minor?. In addition there
are hundreds of free patterns in Internet that with a single click of the mouse
are ready to be able to interpret or to create sequences with them.

In order to be able to make stygmorgan compatible with the well-known cards that
incorporate a Wave Table synthesizer the number of simultaneous tracks that they
reproduce are decreased to 7, incorporating the Percussion track to the Battery
track.

But everything is not gold what shines, some .STY files come with the sounds in
another standard (XG), and normally when you import some style done with this XG
standard is necessary to modify some parameters, even so usually is not too much
what there is to change.

This software has been developed in a pIII 933 with a sound card Creative Labs
sblive (emu10k1) in an a Linux debian (sid) with kernel 2.6.17, but it is more
than probable that it can then work in other much less powerful processors :-)
it does not require of much power of process. 



Requirements
============

- Linux, this software will not be ported to Win32 contrary to which it took with
  gmorgan, so I feel much by the Windows users.

- automake-1.9, maybe you can compile with older versions of automake but
  automake1.9 version is recommended.

- ALSA, stygmorgan uses the ALSA sequencer , so it must be compiled in-kernel or
  activated like module. 

- FLTK, Is the graphical toolkit used by stygmorgan, good, pretty and cheap.

- A MIDI keyboard, is indispensable to use stygmorgan like organ, not thus if it
  is tried to use the sequencer.

- A sound card with Wave Table synthesizer or a software synthesizer of those
  characteristics or an external source of sound compatible General Midi.


stygmorgan is completely configurable and it can use any source of sound
although it is not General Midi but for that it would have to edit all the
sounds and patterns.

How to start?
=============
 
stygmorgan is distributed with a example files of styles and sounds for a
General Midi capable device, therefore first who is needed it is a sound source
with this standard.

If you are possessor of a sound card that incorporates a wave table synthesizer
, you will need load a General Midi compatible soundfont, for sound cards like
the emu10k1 we use the program "awesfx" <c> Takahasi Iwai available in most of
linux distributions, available in the ALSA website: http://www.alsa-project.org

sfxload "soundfont file"

In case of not having some of these wonderful cards you would have to use a soft
synthesizer, we recommend to use Qsynth a qt frontend of Fluidsynth. Lastest
versions work really well with stygmorgan. Anyway you can use command line
synth too ... 

The command line to start Fluidsynth:

fluidsynth "soundfont file"

In case of preferring Timidity the command line is:

timidity - j - iA - B2,8 - You - Efreverb=0

If the configuration file of timidity not exist (/etc/timidity.cfg) you would
have to create it and/or edit adding the following line:

soundfont "soundfont file"

Obvious in all the previous cases "soundfont file" is necessary to replace it by
the path/name of your favorite soundfont. The bad news are that although
compatible with General Midi all soundfonts sounds something different, the
soundfont himself even sounds different for the different soft and hardware
synthesizers.

All the styles that are released with stygmorgan have been mixed using following
soundfont:

ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/awe32/soundfonts/8RealGS20.zip

It's really important to use this soundfont if you want that stygmorgan sounds
without putting much effort, on the other hand, this soundfont is 8 Mb size and
contains near 200 different sounds with acceptable quality.
Once you have the sound source, the only thing that is needed is to execute
stygmorgan, being executed for the first time creates the directory
$HOME/.stygmorgan and puts a copy of the data that distributes the package so
that you can work on them.

When the program start go to the Preferences menu and select your MIDI devices.
Once completed these steps already he is ready to work.

How to improve the sound?
=========================

If you have a sound card emu10k1 compatible then you are a happy man (would have
to pay to me to write this: -)), The soundfont with which has been mixed the
styles has 8Mb size and is from my point of view a small wonder, but obvious,
miracles with 8Mb cannot be done, others soundfonts can have or more quality or,
perhaps better expressed, can be more of your affability, thanks to the friend
Takahashi Iwai and his package awesfx is possible to load many soundfonts in the
sound card, is enough with specifying the number of bank to which it is desired
that they go, the normal operation thing would be to maintain 8RealGS20.sf2 like
main soundfont and add the others soundfonts to other banks in the following
form:

asfxload 8RealGS20.sf2; asfxload - b3 "soundfontfile"

We would have the sounds of the second soundfont in bank three, to be able to
use them is simple, only it must open the window of "More Parameters" of the
channel that wishes, (button "+") in each channel of the stygmorgan mixer and
put "3" in the parameter MSB so that that sound uses it bank 3, obvious must
assign a number of program in the channel of the mixer and save the sound u/o
style that has modified if you wants that the changes are permanent. They are
hundreds of soundfonts available in Internet of a great quality, not to mention
the commercial ones.

If you did the mentioned previously, you will observe that it does not appear
the name of the sound, this has easy solution editing the file found in your
$HOME/.stygmorgan GMPresetlist.txt , the file format is Bank, Program, Name of
Sound:

0 61 Brass Section 

And this is simple if you use the utility 'sf2text' included in the package
awesfx of the friend Takahashi Iwai who lists the content of programs of a
soundfont file to a text file, then you only need to add to which already it
has, things that can be done easily with a text editor. 

Load DSP effects in a emu10k1 or compatible sound card
======================================================

If you wish to obtain exactly same sound of the demos of stygmorgan you need to
use a hardware similar to emu10k1 and use the soundfont with which the example
styles have been mixed, but you will need to load the DSP effects (Reverb and
Chorus) in his hardware, for it is used the package "ld10k1" <c> Peter Zubaj
that usually are available in all the distributions, available in:

http://ld10k1.sf.net

with stygmorgan are released the DSP effects used for the preparation of the
example styles, unfortunately they are many sound cards with different
processors, thus is necessary to compile the effects provided for each card,
this can be done with the program "as10k1" available in the 'alsa-tools' package
or in the ALSA website previously mentioned. The way is coping all the files
".asm" to a directory and execute for each one:

as10k1 "file.asm" 

This generates "file.emu10k1" that is indeed those that is loaded in the memory
of the sound card. Once compiled the process would be to execute the server
ld10k1 in this way:

ld10k1 - t8 &

Once executed the server, copy the script 'pontodocap' to the directory where
they are all the "file.emu10k1" and execute the script. If you made this
procedure and then executes "alsamixer" you can observethat they appear many new
controls in the mixer and are indeed the controllers of the parameters of the
loaded effects.

I noticed that some mixers like kmix does not accept to add controllers to the
ALSA mixer, if you use kde you would have to close "kmix" before this procedure.
Once completed you can execute "kmix" without problems. 

If you wish to have these effects permanently you can automate this operation at
the boot time, but this already depends much off witch linux distribution you
have and it is not the purpose of this document. In any case you need to know
that although appears many new controls, others disappear, the ALSA scripts
executed when the system halts keeps the state of the mixer, obvious kept all
the mixer data from the new controllers, but if there are not loaded in the next
reboot will appear some errors in screen complaining the lack of that controller
not exist at the moment of this boot procedure, no one of these errors is
worrisome, and in any case, you can always force reload ALSA before halt with
the command:

/etc/init.d/alsa force-reload 

ATTENTION: All this procedures loadind DSP effects are dangerous, if you are not
an advanced user, the best thing is than it does not try it, it must know that
all this software is in experimental phase, and that could damage the speakers.
In addition there are many probabilities that the provided effects do not adjust
exactly to the capacities of your sound card, this has been tested with a
Creative Labs sblive with a emu10k1 kernel module: 00:09.0 0401:1102: 0002 (rev
0a) 00:09.1 0980:1102: 7002 (rev 0a).

Probably, now you know, is better if someone translates the docs :-)
